standalone payment and subscription management module.

This module can integrate with other systems, providing product/package management, one-time and recurring payments, invoicing, and online payment capabilities. It includes two main roles:

Admin (SaaS Company) – Uses an Admin Panel to manage products, packages, and billing.
Client (Software User) – Uses a Payment Dashboard to view current subscriptions, invoices/receipts, and make payments.


--- ### **1. Overview & Context** > I need a **payment and subscription module** that complements an existing (or future) software system. This module should allow: > - **Admins (the SaaS provider)** to create and manage different product offerings, subscription tiers, one-time payment products, and handle invoicing. > - **Clients (end-users of the software)** to view their current subscription package, see payment history and receipts, and process payments (including card payments, PayPal, or other payment gateways).
Key objectives:

Product & Package Management: Create multiple plans (monthly, yearly, or custom intervals) and one-time purchase items.
Recurring Subscription: Automated billing, prorated charges if upgrading mid-cycle, subscription cancellation, and renewal.
One-Time Payment: Ability to charge for standalone products or add-ons.
Invoice & Receipt Generation: Auto-generate invoices for each billing cycle or one-time payment, maintain a payment history for clients.
Payment Processing: Integration with online payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure transactions.


--- ### **2. User Roles & Permissions**
# 2.1 Admin (SaaS Company)

Recurring Billing Mechanics

Automatically charge on a schedule (monthly, yearly, etc.).
Proration for mid-cycle upgrades/downgrades (charge the difference or credit partial amounts).

Receipt Management

After payment success, generate a receipt the client can view or download as PDF.
Store receipts in the system for compliance, auditing, or user reference.
Tax & Discounts (Optional Advanced)

Support applying tax rates or VAT based on user location.
Discount Codes/Coupons for promotions (e.g., 10% off for 3 months).


--- ### **6. Dashboards & UI**
# Admin Panel at /admin/dashboard

Main Dashboard: Show total MRR (monthly recurring revenue), new sign-ups, churn.
tab = Product/Plan Management: Create/edit subscription tiers and track active vs. inactive plans.
tab = Customer Insights: List of all customers, their current plans, payment status, usage stats (if integrated).
tab = Invoices: Access to all generated invoices, filter by paid/unpaid, date range, or subscription plan.

# Client Dashboard at /dashboard

Subscription Overview: Displays active plan, next bill date, usage limits (if any).
Payment Methods: Add or update credit card/PayPal details.
Invoice & Receipt History: Download PDFs, see status (paid, pending).
Upgrade/Downgrade: Step-by-step plan change process (with cost difference or immediate prorated charge info).


--- ### **7. Security & Compliance**
# Payment Data

Do not store raw credit card info; use tokenization (e.g., Stripe’s or Braintree’s secure vault).
Ensure PCI-DSS compliance if you’re directly processing card details.
Use HTTPS/TLS for all data in transit.

# User Data

Secure authentication with tokens (JWT) or session-based.
Role-based access (Admin vs. Client) to protect sensitive admin functionalities.

# Audit Logs

Track who changed plan details, performed refunds, or edited invoices.
Keep logs for compliance or dispute resolution.

backend: laravel with mysql (this project)

frontend: react (another project)



--- ### **9. Example Workflow**
Admin Creates a Plan: “Pro Plan” – $29/month, with a 14-day free trial.
Client Signs Up: They select “Pro Plan,” enters payment details on a secure form.
Subscription Activation: The system creates a recurring subscription in Stripe (or similar).
Billing Cycle: Each month, Stripe automatically charges the client’s card. The module receives a webhook, marks the invoice “Paid,” and updates the user’s status.
Client Dashboard: The user sees “Pro Plan,” next billing date, invoices, and receipts. They can cancel or upgrade/downgrade from here.
Admin Analytics: Admin sees subscription revenue, active subscriptions, and any failed payments or at-risk accounts.


--- --- ### **10. Prioritize Features**
Subscription Management (create, update, cancel, view).
One-Time Purchases (one-click buy, invoice generation).
Payment Gateway Integration (choose at least one to fully demonstrate).
Basic Invoicing & Receipts.
Role-Based Dashboards: Admin vs. Client.
